⚽ Built with Football Love on highly Caffeinated Code Sessions ☕


A lightweight real-time system for tracking soccer ball movement in broadcast footage using a Kalman Filter and YOLOv11. Designed for handling partial occlusions, missed detections, and camera motion using confidence-aware prediction.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Detect soccer ball, players, goalkeepers, and referees in match footage.
- Predict the ball’s position even when occluded or not detected.
- Compare predicted vs. actual positions using error metrics.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- `YOLOv11` (via Ultralytics) for detection  
- `Kalman Filter` (`pykalman`) for trajectory tracking  
- `Supervision` for annotated video rendering  
- `Roboflow` for model hosting  
- `ONNX Runtime` GPU acceleration on Colab

## 🧪 Workflow Overview

1. 🔍 **Detection**  
   YOLOv11 detects objects in each video frame (ball, players, etc.).

2. 📈 **Tracking**  
   A Kalman Filter smooths and predicts ball positions based on confidence scores.

3. 🎥 **Visualization**  
   Annotated video is generated with actual vs. predicted positions.

4. 📊 **Evaluation**  
   Errors (mean, RMSE, max) between prediction and ground truth are visualized and stored.

🧠 Kalman Filter Model

Tracks [x, y, vx, vy, ax, ay] using a constant acceleration model:

state = [position_x, position_y, velocity_x, velocity_y, acceleration_x, acceleration_y]
